            <div class="text-content">
                <p>The term ‘Black Lives Matter’ first came forth <strong>in 2013, created</strong> by three African American women by the names Alicia Garza, Patrisse Cullors, and Opal Tometi. The creation of this movement  <strong>was in response to the murder</strong> of 17-year-old African American Trayvon Martin in Florida in February 2012, and, more particularly, the acquittal of his murderer, George Zimmerman.</p>
                <p><strong>Fast forward to the 2020s</strong>, where Black Lives Matter has grown into a widespread social and political movement. This resurgence was largely fueled by the murder of 46-year-old <strong>George Floyd</strong> in May of 2020, at the hands of police officer Derek Chauvin, after the call to police by a grocery store employee, over the suspicion that Floyd used a counterfeit $20 bill.</p>
                <p><strong>Police body cam footage</strong> of the ordeal was released to the public, with its cruel and vicious nature driving the media focus on this specific case of police brutality. This footage became a turning point, sparking protests across all 50 states and numerous countries worldwide. Social media played a crucial role in transforming George Floyd’s death from a single tragic event into <strong>a pivotal moment</strong> in the fight for racial justice.</p>
                <p><strong>The impact of social media</strong> on political awareness surrounding BLM in the 2020s cannot be overstated. Platforms like Twitter, Instagram, TikTok, and Facebook became critical tools for activists, enabling the <strong>rapid dissemination of information</strong>, the organization of protests, and the amplification of Black voices and experiences. Hashtags such as <strong>#BlackLivesMatter, #JusticeForGeorgeFloyd</strong>, and <strong>#SayTheirNames</strong> trended worldwide, drawing millions into conversations about racial injustice. Viral videos, infographics, and personal accounts educated global audiences, many of whom had previously been unaware of the extent of systemic racism and police violence in the United States and beyond.</p>
                <p>In particular, <strong>from 2013 to 2018</strong>, the hashtag #BlackLivesMatter had been tweeted approximately <strong>30 million times</strong>, roughly 708 times per hour. From July 2018 to June 2020, the hashtag had been tweeted approximately <strong>48 million times</strong>.</p>
                <p>As a result of this surge in online activity and popularity of BLM, many related organizations received large amounts of money in the form of donations. Specifically, from May 2020 through to December 2020, <strong>10.6 billion dollars were donated</strong>, which would be the equivalent of 12.92 billion today.</p>
                <p>Beyond raising awareness, <strong>social media also democratized activism</strong>, allowing individuals who might not attend protests <strong>to contribute</strong> to the movement <strong>in other ways</strong>, such as donating to bail funds, signing petitions, or sharing educational resources. However, this increased visibility also drew criticism and scrutiny, with some accusing online activism of <strong>failing to create substantive, long-term change</strong>. Despite these critiques, the digital realm’s capacity to create collective action and influence policy discussions through shock. cannot be ignored.</p>
                <p><strong>The Black Lives Matter</strong> movement’s prominence in the 2020s illustrates how social media has transformed political engagement. By breaking down barriers to information and connecting individuals across the globe, these platforms have reshaped how we understand and respond to social justice issues. While challenges remain, the role of <strong>social media</strong> in advancing BLM highlights its potential as a powerful force for societal change.</p>
